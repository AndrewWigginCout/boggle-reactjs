# Description

Welcome to my Boggle implementation in React JS.
Boggle is a board game, with lettered dice. The dice create a random grid of letters.
You play the game by finding a sequence of cells that spell out words.

For those unfamiliar with React, a lot of this code is boilerplate. My code is in /src/App.js

# Install Instructions

Assuming a properly installed Node environment,
you need to drop this git into a generic npm react app. Do:
```
npx create-react-app
```

Then delete the newly created .git folder if it makes it, and copy my .git into the project root.
```
git reset --hard
```
will write and overwrite all the files in the master commit, populating the directory with my source codes.

Then you can run
```
npm start
```
to start the app.
